# DrewPost - A social networking website.
DrewPost is a social networking website written by Drew Graham in early 2013. The site has gone through many different phases<br>
such as using exisiting Facebook or Twitter clone scripts and also many versions written by him in PHP. In mid 2014 devleopment<br>
on DrewPost halted and ended. In March of 2015 he decided to start work on DrewPost again. This build is the current stable build.

<h3>Development</h3>
Since I wanted to have more people than me thinking of ideas and implementing them into the site, I thought it would be a good<br> 
idea to make the project open-source and allow anyone to see the code and implement features. If you are interested in having push<br>
access to the DrewPost repository please email me at djgraham@att.net. 

<h3>How I develop DrewPost</h3>
A lot of the time I am not using a IDE to write the code. I have written alot of it in the code editor in cPanel and the HTML using<br>
a real-time HTML editor located at <a href='http://htmledit.squarefree.com/'>htmledit.squarefree.com</a>. When I am using a IDE To write the<br>
the code I use Microsoft WebMatrix on Windows and MaxCode on OS X.

If you use the source of DrewPost in one of your projects please tell me(djgraham@att.net) so I can see what<br>
creations you make with it!
